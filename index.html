    <p>"We gave the Ferrari 296 GTB full marks, the lesser-spotted 10/10 reserved only for the best of the very best. Which got us wondering, which cars do we actually think are the best of the very best? A search through the TG archive has revealed these thoroughbreds."" </p>
    <h3>Bugatti Chiron</h3>

    <p>Veyron's successor is a car that does things no other car can; one with a distinct personality.”</p>
    <h3>Porsche Singer DLS</h3>

    <p>“Singer's Dynamics and Lightweighting Study is indulgent, rewarding and intense, an even bigger step on from one of their normal restorations than we’d expected.”</p>
    <h3>Toyota GR Yaris</h3>

    <h3>Audi Quattro</h3>
